                <p>In today's modern world, where users visit websites from devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions,
                   the concept of responsive design is a highly important component of web development. Responsive design is 
                   the process of creating websites with a flexible design that changes to the device being used.
                   automatically adjusts the contents of the web page to the display size of the device on which it is being viewed.
                   The concept of responsive web design also ensures that the webpage's content is preserved and remains same 
                   across all platforms. Responsive design improves the appearance of a website and adds to its functionality.
                   It is possible to show the contents of a webpage in a variety of formats on a variety of devices.
                   sizes of screens. Also, it makes website easily Accessible on a range of platforms, including a phone, a PC, and a tablet. 
                   All these things are made possible via responsive design.
                </p>

                <p>Responsive Design relates to web technologies in many ways. It is the type of design in which it uses a 
                   correct method of displaying web pages in a similar structure on different devices. In responsive design,
                   A certain limit of a breakpoint is determined and a particular design is displayed according to the set of 
                   rules which are determined to display the contents in that limit of breakpoints. The breakpoints are
                   determined by the width of the browser. In responsive design, the elements of the web page gets restructured
                   according to the width of the browser depending on the device on which it is accessed on. Responsive design 
                   makes sure that a website is displayed and it functions and adapts to each type of device. It makes sure that 
                   the website is being rendered and displayed correctly on all types of devices and screen sizes. It also 
                   reduces code redundancy because we don't have to create separate HTML and CSS for different device types, 
                   instead, we utilise a single HTML and CSS for all devices, as well as media queries and responsive grids.
                   Many popular frameworks, like as Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and others,which helps us creating a responsive 
                   website much faster and easier.
                </p>

                <p>From my research of building web apps for different devices, the most important thing that i have learned 
                    is testing of web pages on different websites and on different devices and checking if the web apps are 
                    working perfectly or not. By doing so, we will get to know If there is a problem of displaying contents of the
                    webpage or not. If there are any such problems then it might not be a perfect experiance for the user. An 
                    example of the perfect webpage would be a web page working perfectly on all the devices. Thus, this was about my 
                    research on building web apps.
                </p>
                <p> The overall learning experiance in this course was really great. I have learnt many things about making web pages
                    Firstly in the begining of semester I learned HTML which is used to give a basic format to a web page then I 
                    learnt javascript which is used to give functionality to a web page. Also, I learned CSS which is used to 
                    give different styles and designs to a web page. I also learned the concept of DOM by which we can access and 
                    manipulate a web document. On completion of this course I am able to create any type of website or web page. I 
                    am also able to create a webpage having form validation by using javascript and HTML. Also, in this final assessment 
                    I have learned so many things about form validation and its implementation using javascript and designing a webpage 
                    perfectly in a proper manner. Thus, this was about my learning experiance in this course and it was really good 
                    studying this course.
